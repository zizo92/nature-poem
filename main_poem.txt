This should be a perfect poem about nature at the end of the project.

1. the wind is blowing.
2. the water is rushing to join the see.
3. water is cold and dark.
4. The mountain is snowy and awesome.
5. the jungle is always a great gift.

6. I wanna try to add a lot about the rain.
this is the rain that remembers me...
